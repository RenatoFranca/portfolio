## Setup

Steps to setup the project:

### 1. Clone the repo:

```
git clone git@github.com:RenatoFranca/renatofranca.com.git
```

### 2. Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd renatofranca.com
```

### 3. Install dependencies:

```
yarn
```

## Local Language Debugging

To aid in local development, especially when testing multi-language support, the `DEBUG_LANGUAGE` environment variable can be used.

### Setup

1. Create a `.env.local` file in your project's root directory if it doesn't already exist.
2. Add the `DEBUG_LANGUAGE` variable with the desired locale code. For example:

```
DEBUG_LANGUAGE=pt-br
```

This will override the automatic language detection and set the application's language to Portuguese during development.

### Notes

- The `DEBUG_LANGUAGE` setting is only intended for local development and should not be used in production.
- Remember to restart your development server after making changes to the `.env.local` file.
